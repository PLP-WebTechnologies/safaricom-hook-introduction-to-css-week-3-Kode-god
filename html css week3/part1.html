    <h1>Principles of Programming</h1> 
    <p> <strong>The principles of programming</strong> refer to the fundamental concepts and guidelines 
      that help programmers write efficient, maintainable, and understandable code. 
      These principles are often applied across various programming languages and paradigms, 
      and they provide a foundation for software development.
    </p> 
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <p> Some of the key principles of programming include:</p>
        <p>
         
          1. Abstraction
           Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of a system.
           It simplifies the complexity of a program by focusing on high-level functionalities and making the system easier to understand and use.
           Using functions or classes to hide the complexity of specific tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Encapsulation
           Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, often a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
           It helps in protecting data from unintended changes and promotes modularity and maintenance.
           Using private variables in a class and exposing only necessary methods (getters/setters).
